# soos - Bare Metal Hello World
The project is organized in three principal folders: hexadecimal, assembly and C. Each one has it's own Makefile and necessary files.
Unfortunately, we couldn't implement the same hello world in each code. In hexadecimal code, we were able to change the default screen color and print the regular hw message. The assembly implementation was the one with most features, the screen color is changing as hexadecimal code, each letter is displayed with a delay elapsed between them, 2 messages are displayed in different lines and the emulator is shutdown after a while. The last one was the C implementation and we weren't able to change the screen color, it's only displaying the hw message, with each letter displayed with a delay.
